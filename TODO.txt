Small things
- Create test for scene files
- Fix small TODO's throughout code
- Create smoke test for renderer
- Use OpenCL optimized vector types
- Tent filter

Big things (milestones)
- Realtime rendering
    - optimize things
    - partial rendering (collect pixel samples across multiple SYCL kernel runs)
    - only copy to GPU changed data structures between frames
- Model rendering
    - Ray/Triangle intersection
- BVH tree for rendering many primatives in scene
- Minecraft world renderer (A nice practical application of the Tracer renderer)
- None perfect diffuse/reflection/refraction
